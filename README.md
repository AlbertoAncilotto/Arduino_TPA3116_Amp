# A TPA3116 & Arduino powered Amp

## Intro

Browsing websites like Aliexpress, it is very easy to find a ton of very cheap, small class-D amplifiers with good power ratings - from sub 0.50€, 3W-capable boards based on a `PAM8403` IC, to 500W `IRS2092S`-based amps for 8€.

Some of these ICs, when coupled with a decent power supply and good quality passives, can offer a remarkable audio quality - it is easy to find many blog posts of audiophiles online claiming performances close to those of amplifiers setups costing thousands of euros. Now, while I am not an audiophile by any stretch of the imagination, I enjoy finding ways to combine my love for electronics and the world of DIY audio - and i have recently got my hands on a couple of old, 60W Yamaha studio monitors which I really wanted to give new life to.

This project's goal is to go from a bare `TPA3116`-based board into a full, standalone amp with Arduino-powered bells and whistles (display with power and temperature monitoring), and show the different hardware and software aspects of the project - it should be relatively easy to adapt to work with different boards or displays.
